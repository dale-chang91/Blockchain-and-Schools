# Improving Schools with Technology

This repository aims to improve the quality of education in schools by integrating the following technologies:
* Blockchain & Smart contracts
* Big Data & Distributed computing
* Mobile apps
* Machine Learning & Analytics
* Security
* And more

#### Goal
The aim of this project is to integrate, enhance, and elevate the quality of education within schools. This platform will help teach students while streamlining the workload that teachers face. Ideally the underlying computer hardware should be supplied by schools and linked to teachers' and students' smartphones, and the software should be pulled by an organization within a school (such as a computer club) or by a county school board. These individuals are allowed to have free reign to modify the platform as they see fit with their education goals.

#### Technology in more Detail
##### Blockchain & Smart Contracts
As we have seen with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cryptokitties, and other applications employing both the blockchain and smart contracts, it stands to believe that this could be useful within schools. Every time a separate blockchain application is created, we see that a community grows around its followers. At the same time, smart contracts allow instantaneous agreements and transactions to take place. In an initial, teachers would be able to assign homework and provide the answer key to students at the same time; in order to complete the assignment, the student would need to submit the correct answers in order to receive full credit. Further improving this idea, teachers can allow partial credit for math or science if a student provided the correct idea or formulas, but made a sign error or computational error. This can also be extended to liberal arts with students having to provide answers to a reading comprehension question. 

In traditional blockchains, the application itself awards an internal currency to cryptocurrency miners. Instead, schools can use this to incentivize better performance in school with internal perks. Teachers can reward students for community service or extra credit with an internal currency which the student can later use to redeem for higher quality lunches, school supplied, etc.

In the case of a mobile application, students could install a mobile app to their smartphones that would provide teacher-assigned flashcards for homework. For a foreign language class, the app can require the students to provide the foreign language word equivalent to the mother tongue; also it could use speech-to-text to make sure that students are pronouncing words correctly. For math and science, flashcards can be used to reinforce problem solving.

An area of concern is whether or not this internal currency should be able to be traded between students or not. If trading is enabled, it would provide more power to the students who are higher achievers. 

The ideal outcome of using this platform would be to dissolve the boundaries of concrete subject areas, which would have the following results:
* Self-paced learning. 
  * Students excelling in Algebra 1 can advance to Algebra 2 quickly. 
* Bringing the joy back to teaching and learning
  * Teachers will be able to teach subjects that they are interested 
  * A Colonial American History teacher would not have to teach Modern American history.
* Generalized lectures
  * In conjunction with the analytics section, teachers can figure out which areas are lacking across the student body and hold lectures on those
  * Students can pick the lectures that they are interested in or will provide them the most help

##### Big Data & Machine Learning Analytics
Schools can use this platform to better track how students are performing in subject areas and can identify areas of improvement. This integrates nicely with the standardized learning requirements of public schools. Math teachers can track areas where students are excelling and lagging behind by tracking students answers. For example, Student A misses more calculus integration questions than calculus derivative questions, and the student's teacher can tailor lectures and questions to improve this deficiency. This effect will bring education to a more personal level.

Combined with a smartphone application, students can keep track of how they are performing in school in real-time. Often, the analog teaching methods obscure and abstract the true details of how students are performing. Instead, pie charts and graphs can show how well students are scoring in subjects as well as their progress over time. This is much like how video games display the progression of video game characters.

Additional areas of concern could be in students' dietary preferences. If students are ordering more chicken nuggets across the board while ordering less lasagna, the school can modify their spending budget accordingly. Physical education teachers can track student improvement through databases instead of writing progress down on paper + clipboards.
