# Improving Schools with Technology

This repository aims to improve the quality of education in schools by integrating the following technologies:
* Blockchain
* Smart contracts
* Social media
* Big Data & Distributed computing
* Mobile apps
* Machine Learning & Analytics
* Security
* And more

#### Goal
The aim of this project is to integrate, enhance, and elevate the quality of education within schools. This platform will help teach students while streamlining the workload that teachers face. Ideally the underlying computer hardware should be supplied by schools and linked to teachers' and students' smartphones, and the software should be pulled by an organization within a school (such as a computer club) or by a county school board. These individuals are allowed to have free reign to modify the platform as they see fit with their education goals.

#### Technology in more Detail
##### Blockchain & Smart Contracts
As we have seen with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cryptokitties, and other applications employing both the blockchain and smart contracts, it stands to believe that this could be useful within schools. Every time a separate blockchain application is created, we see that a community grows around its followers. At the same time, smart contracts allow instantaneous agreements and transactions to take place. In an initial, teachers would be able to assign homework and provide the answer key to students at the same time; in order to complete the assignment, the student would need to submit the correct answers in order to receive full credit. Further improving this idea, teachers can allow partial credit for math or science if a student provided the correct idea or formulas, but made a sign error or computational error. This can also be extended to liberal arts with students having to provide answers to a reading comprehension question. 

In the case of a mobile application, students could install a mobile app to their smartphones that would provide teacher-assigned flashcards for homework. For a foreign language class, the app can require the students to provide the foreign language word equivalent to the mother tongue; also it could use speech-to-text to make sure that students are pronouncing words correctly. For math and science, flashcards can be used to reinforce problem solving.

##### Big Data & Machine Learning Analytics
Schools can use this platform to better track how students are performing in subject areas and can identify areas of improvement. This integrates nicely with the standardized learning requirements of public schools. Math teachers can track areas where students are excelling and lagging behind by tracking students answers. For example, Student A misses more calculus integration questions than calculus derivative questions, and the student's teacher can tailor lectures and questions to improve this deficiency. This effect will bring education to a more personal level.

Additional areas of concern could be in students' dietary preferences. If students are ordering more chicken nuggets across the board while ordering less lasagna, the school can modify their spending budget accordingly.
